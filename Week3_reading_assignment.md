## Reading "Off the Grid... and Back Again? The Recent Evolution of American Street Network Planning and Design" by Geoff Boeing ##

It was really interesting to read Boeing's piece because it explored an apsect of the urban fabric that is important but that I don't alway think about: street networks. Street networks as explained by Boeing, have a large impact on how residents navigate cities. One of these impacts is on vehicle usage. When street networks are denser and more interconnected, then there's less car usage. This is an important discovery and I am interested in how this can be used to help address transportation related inequities in low-income communities of color. What redevelopments can be used to make street networks more interconnected in these communities? Is the solution in these communities public transportation to make them more interconnected? In many low-income commmunities, street networks are already dense and interconnected, but the issue is that there is not enough access to public transportation. For example, in the Fruitvale community in Oakland, there are dense street networks, but they are currently developing a new bus transit system along the primary arterial street. Overall, I expect to pay extra attention to street networks as I navigate cities personally and professionally.
