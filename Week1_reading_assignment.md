The article, written by Rob Hayes from ABC7 News discusses the increasing unhealthy levels of smog in Southern California. As a result, communities across Southern California are being extra cognizant and cautious about their exposure to the outside air. According to several medical professionals including Jill Johnston, an environmental health scientist at the USC Keck School of Medicine, air quality is only worsening and consequently presents a greater risk to impacted communities. The article also features a map that provides a spatial analysis of air quality across the Los Angeles Metropolitan Region. The map shows that inland communities in Santa Clarita and the Inland Empire are disporportionately impacted by poor air quality.

As someone who is particularly interested in environmental justice and was raised in the Inland Empire, this article was incredibly reaffirming of the environmental injustices that impact my community. In reading this article I also discovered an interesting parraelel with air quality patterns and which communities are disporportionately impacted by poor air quality: low-income people are currently being pushed out of LA due to housing shortage and unaffordability to more affordable places like the Inland Empire where they are trading cleaner air for unhealthy air. Obviously, they are not making this air trade out of real preference, but rather out of necessity to live in a place they can afford. Furthermore, housing shortages and unaffordability are not only displacing lower-income residents, but they are likely displacing them to Los Angeles' unhealthiest communities. This article and case is a prime example of the environmental injustices present in Southern California. Furthermore, reading this article was helpful in guiding me towards choosing the Inland Empire as the scale of my research project. It was also impressive to see how mapping could be used to inform people of environmental inequities by providing air quality spatial data points across the LA Metropolitan Region. Similarly, I plan to use spatial data as a tool to uncover and present patterns/relationships in relation to ineuqities impacting Black/POC low-income communities.
